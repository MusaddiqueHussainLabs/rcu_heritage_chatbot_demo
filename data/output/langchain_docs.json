Berlin, Reimer, 1916. Oblong folio. 106 illustrations on 50 plates, each with separate title, in various sizes. With text booklet (2 ff., 16 pp.). Original half cloth portfolio. Rare photographic work documenting important cities and parts of the countryside in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, and Palestine. Most of the photos were taken by the author during his travels between 1905 and 1915. The images of northern Hijaz, Makkah, and Madinah, which Moritz was unable to visit, were taken by Turkish friends. The images also show the construction of the Hijaz Railway between Damascus and the holy sites of Makkah and Madinah, as well as views of Madinah, Makkah, Jeddah, Petra, and Jerusalem. Plates and text are well preserved; portfolio shows slight traces of repairs. {BN#34095} The author, Bernhard Moritz (1859-1939), was a German archaeologist and Orientalist. He participated in several German archaeological expeditions in Egypt and Mesopotamia in particular. Between 1887 and 1896 he served as a secretary, librarian and teacher of Arabic at the Friedrich-Wilhelms University in Berlin, and between 1896 and 1911 he headed up the Khedival Library and Archive in Cairo. It was from here that he undertook several research trips to the Sinai and Hijaz regions. Images 55 to 60 shows AlUla well, AlUla station and Hegra. -> en, Curatorial Significance: Thi is a rare photographic work, comprising photographs of various scenes across the Middle East, specifically Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt and Palestine. The majority of the photographs were taken by the author, German archaeologist and Arabist Bernhard Moritz (b.1859- d.1939), between 1905 and 1915. The images taken include: views of Jerusalem, Makkah, Madinah, the Hijaz, Jeddah, Petra and Mount Sinai; street scenes in Makkah and Madinah, villages and across the desert; and portraits. Of most significance to RCU, the collection includes scenes of the Hijaz Railway and its construction, portraits of the Arab men who worked on the Railway, and Hajj pilgrims, as well as images related to the Hijaz Railway in Al- Ula itself, and of the heritage sites (see Appendix). There is a strong documentary nature to the collection, as the images are accompanied by explanatory text in German from Bernhard Moritz. This is a rare historical photographic documentation regarding the construction of the Railway and its locations in Al-Ula that will easily serve a number of research, interpretation and display requirements for RCU. The collection and its origins are of particular relevance to the Journeys and",

The last pages are about Al Ola and Wejh. Pages 209 and onwards depict al Tayma-Al Hijr-Al Ola.This journal is significant for J. Euting descriptions of the nearby regions of Balad El Shams, al Ha’il and Tay’ma supporting the understanding of the county, Arabia and history of travellers. His journal also shows that he spent at least a night in Al Ola with the french explorer Charles Huber. Huber and Euting were the first travellers to travel to Al-Ula, before Jaussen and Savignac who took the first pictures of Al-Ula and Madain Saleh.This journal shows once again the interest in the region by explorer eager to be the first to discover and write about the landscape, history, culture and archaeology of Al’Ula.",

So he settled in al-Ula, and decided to leave (desert) the Bedouin and move in the desert looking to pastures for the sake of his livestock and animals.

No.: RCU.2021.40.1 Title: Travels in Arabia Deserta, Vol. 1 Artists / Makers: Charles Doughty, Author Material: paper (fiber product); Material Date: 1888 AD Dimensions: 22,2 x 15,5 x 4,9 cm Description: -> en, Artistic / Historical Context: Green clothe cover and gold lettering volume 1 of Travels to Arabia Deserta by C.M. Doughty. Charles Montagu Doughty (1843-1926) was an English writer and explorer who travelled around Arabia with the Bedouin in the late 1800s. He chose to travel in the pilgrim caravan from Damascus to Makkah in November 1876, visiting AlUla, Hail and Khaybar before arriving at Jeddah on the Red Sea in August 1878. His books documenting his travels, Travels in Arabia Deserta, were published in 1888. These were the first records of AlUla’s monuments to reach Europe and inspired further explorers to visit the site and record more of the archaeological and epigraphic wonders discovered there. The book was rediscovered by T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) in the 1920s and was republished with an introduction by Lawrence himself -> en, Curatorial Significance: This text is significant for several reasons. It is a first edition of the book detailing the first European’s visit to AlUla in millennia. Doughty’s book revealed the importance of AlUla as a powerful capital city with an impressive archaeological, historical and epigraphic record to the world for the first time. It sensitively yet surely describes the lives and practices of both settled citizens and Bedouin living in AlUla in the late nineteenth century, documenting their customs and emphasising their role as the friendly guardians of the oasis. The records provided by Doughty also detail AlUla and its surroundings prior to non-local intervention and the radical changes of the early twentieth century. This text also inspired archaeologists, epigraphers and adventurers from across the world to visit AlUla and discover more about its important history and peoples that had been forgotten for centuries. The book also documents relationships between Britain and the Arab world, as well as the interactions of Christians and Muslims, forming a starting point for the beginning of modern international relations in Arabia. Its global significance can also be seen in its reprinting by Lawrence of Arabia: despite being forty years old when reissued, Lawrence understood its value as a detailed account of both past and present life within northwestern Saudi Arabia. This book could be successfully displayed the potential Journeys and Travellers section within the Life and Memory Galleries, demonstrating the importance of the written word and first- hand accounts in connecting AlUla to the wider world.",

Waldseemuller, who was also the author of the first map to name America, drew on Ptolemy’s work to create maps of the classical and contemporary world. The map stretches west to east from the Red Sea to a rather distended Arabian Gulf. Due a miscalculation on the part of Ptolemy, “the Arabian Peninsula appears wider than it actually is. This extra width is in the south, whereas the north, which was better known as it was on the land trade routes linking the Mediterranean to the Arabian Gulf, was included by Ptolemy but he added an excessive distance to the Gulf which appears completely distorted in a rectangular shape with its longest side oriented east west” (Al Ankary). -> en, Curatorial Significance: There are two possible mentions of AlUla: 'Aulara' or 'Aluara'. -> en, Object description: Claudius Ptolemaeus Sexta Asiae Tabula Paper 1513 -> ar, Object description:  ﺑطﻠﯾﻣوس ﻛﻠودﯾوس ﻵﺳﯾﺎ اﻟﺳﺎدﺳﺔ اﻟﺧرﯾطﺔ ورﻗﺔ م.1513",

This is the first illustrated edition of Ptolemy’s work in which an attempt was made to update the information given on the maps, and the only Italian edition of Ptolemy to feature woodcut maps. It is also one of the earliest examples of two-colour printing in cartography, with the major regional names printed in red, others in black, using inset type. Woodward suggests that the dual-colour printing style is done to mimic contemporary portolan charts, which used black and red to distinguish toponyms of various importance. The text in the book says that it used the maps of navigators to update Ptolemy’s original work, and the influence may also have extended to the aesthetic (Woodward). Sylvanus had already produced an edition of Ptolemy in Naples in 1490, but this was to be based on different principles. He explains in a preliminary note that Ptolemy’s work must be updated, and adds that as Ptolemy himself used the work of navigators, so will he. Sylvanus was trying to tread a delicate line between critics of Ptolemy’s work and those who appreciated the framework provided by the classical geographer (Dalche). -> en, Curatorial Significance: There are two possible mentions of AlUla: 'Aufara' or 'Aluara' Hegra is also likely to be marked as 'Egra'.",

From the first book of Jan Huygen van Linschoten’s ‘Itinerario’, the first printed work to include precise sailing instructions for the East Indies. It allowed Dutch merchants to circumvent the Portuguese stranglehold on trade to the East. It was of such economic utility that “it was given to each ship sailing from Holland to India” and soon became “the navigator’s vade mecum for the Eastern seas” (Penrose). Jan Huyghen van Linschoten (1563–1611) left the Netherlands for Spain in 1576 and secured passage to India in 1583 as secretary to Dominican Vicente da Fonseca, the newly-appointed Portuguese Archbishop of Goa, which gave him access to secret information, including the EastIndies portolan charts guarded for over a century. With an impressive disregard for the trust placed in him, Linschoten began to copy these maps meticulously. On his return to the Netherlands, he wrote an account of his travels in 1595 with prints based on his own drawings and maps incorporating the information stolen from the Portuguese. The first book is especially valuable for its eyewitness account of India, as one of the few Renaissance works on the East to be illustrated from life. Linschoten’s description of Goa is “one of the most original and reliable narratives prepared during the sixteenth century on life at the hub of Portugal’s Eastern empire and still is regarded as one of the best sources for Goa’s history at the peak of its glory”. -> en, Curatorial Significance: The region of Egias (Hijaz) is identified on the map.",

Despite the key role that the Arabian Peninsula and waters had played in Mediterranean trade for centuries, European cartographers had paid surprisingly little attention to the area. The lack of rivers and waterways made Arabia particularly difficult to chart, but the exploration of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries did see a number of new maps being produced. These, however, were generally littered with errors, which were then compounded as later mapmakers drew on the inaccurate work of their predecessors. -> en, Artistic / Historical Context: The present map was the result of German exploration in the region during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Mathematician and cartographer, Carsten Niebuhr, had travelled around the Gulf from 1761 to 1767, and upon his return published a series of maps that opened the region up to the European eye. Following in his footsteps were two scientists, L.G. Ehrenberg and Eduard Rüppell, who voyaged over the Red Sea and through Ethiopia in the 1820s. The latter was the first European explorer to reach the Gulf of Aqaba, collecting zoological specimens. When both men had returned to Germany, the present map was published from their research. The map shows Arabia as it was in 1835. At this time, the Khedivate of Egypt, a tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, controlled most of the land depicted, including Sudan, the Nubian desert, the Levant, large swathes of Arabia and the western portion of Yemen. Muhammad Ali Pasha, the leader of the Khedivate from 1805 to 1848, had won much of this territory in the first half of his reign, but the Al Saud family had continued to rule the Najd region which dominates the centre of the peninsula, outlined on the map in pink. In 1841, after Pasha’s unsuccessful rebellion against the Ottoman Sultan, he was forced to concede the peninsula, which has henceforth been under Saudi Arabian dynastic rule. Of particular interest are the inset maps, which show the Holy Cities. The blue trompe l’oeil map in the centre presents the caravan route taken by pilgrims from Jeddah to Mecca, continuing on to Taife. Hachures show the relief of the surrounding mountains, and towns along the route are identified. Aerial plans of Mecca and Medina in the upper right corner provide additional perspectives on these important sites. -> en, Curatorial Significance: The map contains a nice contoured detail with the place names of Medain Saleh, Hedjer and Aala (AlUla) and adds to the chronology of mapping the region:",

No.: RCU.2021.110 Title: Sexta Asia (Sexta Asiae Tabula) Artists / Makers: Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) Lienhart Holle Nicolaus  Germanus Material: paper (fiber product) Date: 1482 Dimensions: Object dimensions 357 x 544 mm Description: -> en, Artistic / Historical Context: The map Sexta Asiae Tabula was part of the first edition of Claudius Ptolemy’s Geographia atlas (known in full as Liber geographiae cum tabulis et eniversali figura et cum additione locorum quae a recentiorbus reperta sunt) to be published outside of Italy, in 1482 in Ulm, Germany. It is markedly different to the Italian editions, most obviously in its aesthetic due to the maps being printed from carved wood blocks rather than copperplate engravings (James Ford Bell Library). The text of the atlas was translated from the original Greek by Jacobus Angelus and first published during the Renaissance in Vicenza (1475), Bologna (1477) and Rome (1478). The 1482 publication is a revised edition of Ptolemy’s Geographia, with his maps re-worked by the cartographer Nicolaus Germanus, and the inclusion of five new ‘modern’ maps depicting Italy, Spain, France, Scandinavia, and the Holy Land. The Ulm edition is considered to have surpassed the previous efforts and is one of the most important publications in cartographical history. In addition to the new maps, the atlas bears other notable firsts – it is the first version of Geographia printed outside of Italy, and the earliest known atlas to have been printed in Germany. It was also the first to contain hand-coloured maps and the first time that maps were signed by the artist responsible for the woodcutting, in this case Johannes of Armsheim who signed the world map and incorporated a backwards N into the woodcut text on each map. It is the first time that accompanying text was printed on the verso of the map to which it refers. Although it was printed in Germany, the paper was imported from Italy. Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100-170 CE) and Arabia Felix Claudius Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus) was a renowned mathematician, astronomer, geography and astrologer. He embodies the idea of the interconnectedness of the ancient Near Eastern world at the time of the Roman Empire; writing in ancient Greek, using Babylonian astronomical data; likely being a Roman citizen whilst being ethnically either Greek or Hellenistic. Ptolemy is an ancient Greek personal name, common in the elite of the time of Alexander the Great the Macedonian leader. There were several high ranking Ptolemies in Alexander's army. One of these generals became pharaoh of Egypt in 323 BCE (Ptolemy I Soter), founding the Ptolemaic dynasty that ruled Egypt until it became part of the Roman Empire with the defeat of the famed Egyptian queen Cleopatra in around 30 BCE (Hill 2006). The name Claudius is an indication of Ptolemy's Roman heritage. The specific combination and styling of the full name, Claudius Ptolemaeus, was typical of Roman citizens at the time, leading historians to suggest Ptolemy had become a naturalised Roman (Hill 2006).",

    "content": "Inv. No.: RCU.2022.441 Title: Short Note on the Design and Issue of Postage Stamps Artists / Makers: Thomas Edward Lawrence Material: paper (fiber product) Date: 1918 AD Description: -> en, Object description: Decorated title-page and frontispiece design incorporating a set of the postage stamp series; twelve colour plates of progressive proofs; two leaves of differently coloured proofs of the stamps loosely inserted, as issued. One of two hundred numbered copies, each with a manuscript colophon. 4to., original decorated paper boards, dust jacket. El- Qahira [Cairo], [Survey of Egypt and Government Press.] It shows postage and tax stamps at initial and final stages. -> en, Artistic / Historical Context: The ’Short Note on the Design and Issue of Postage Stamps’ (the Survey of Egypt for His Highness Husein, Emir & Sherif of Mecca & King of the Hejaz) shows the prices, prints run and calligrapher’s name of each of these stamps,. See last pages of: https://library.si.edu/digital- library/book/shortnoteondesig00egyp It is clear from some of Lawrence's letters home that this was a project which fascinated him in all its aspects: \"It is rather amusing because one has long had ideas as to what a stamp should look like, and how one can put them roughly into practice. The worst is they can only be little designs, not engraved, so that the finer detail is not possible. I'm going to have flavoured gum on the back, so that one may lick without unpleasantness.\" (Cairo. 22nd July 1916.) In the end flavoured gum was not possible: the only available paper was originally intended for the \"opened by the Censor\" labels, and already gummed; the ink used for the blue one piastre stamps was intended for the map work of the Survey of Egypt. The first issue of Hejaz stamps was ultimately very small, and sanctioned by the Allied governments for the duration of the war only: \"They may be valuable some day, for I am not printing many, and have taken steps to prevent any dealers purchasing them in bulk. You have no idea what an enormous and profitable affair the stamps trade is.\" (Cairo. 16th September 1916.) -> en, Curatorial Significance: This shows the commission by Egypt for His Highness Husein, Emir & Sherif of Mecca & King of the Hejaz and the importance of the Hejaz region even in what could be seen as an insignificant usual object: a stamp. (MAM) Ronald Storrs, Oriental Secretary to the Arab Bureau, explained the thinking behind the simple but highly effective and visible means of proclaiming the independence of the Hejaz from the Ottoman Empire in 1916 in his memoir Orientations (1937): “Shortly after the Arab Revolution we found that its success was being denied or blanketed by Enemy Press (which was of course quoted by neutrals), and we decided that the best proof that it had taken place would be provided by an issue of Hejaz postage stamps, which would carry the Arab propaganda, self- paying and incontrovertible, to the four corners of the earth.” (Storrs, Ronald, Orientations, 1937)",
